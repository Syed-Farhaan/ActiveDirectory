# üñ•Ô∏è Active Directory & Splunk Project

## üõ†Ô∏è Objective
To configure an Active Directory domain and integrate Splunk for monitoring, telemetry collection, and security analysis. This project involved setting up Sysmon for event logging, brute force testing using Crowbar, and analyzing failed login attempts.

---

## üéì Skills Learned
- **Active Directory Configuration**: Set up and managed a Windows 10 machine in an AD domain.
- **Log Management**: Installed and configured Splunk for data ingestion and log analysis.
- **Security Monitoring**: Used Sysmon to forward security and system logs for better visibility.
- **Brute Force Attack Simulation**: Employed Crowbar for brute forcing RDP and monitoring failed attempts.
- **Event Analysis**: Detected and analyzed security events using Splunk, particularly failed login attempts.

---

## üîß Tools Used
- **Active Directory**: Managed users, devices, and organizational units.
- **Splunk**: Monitored logs and analyzed security events.
- **Sysmon**: Captured detailed event telemetry from Windows systems.
- **Crowbar**: Performed brute force attacks on RDP.
- **Windows 10**: Added to the domain and used for endpoint security logging.
